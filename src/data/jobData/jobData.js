Key Responsibilities
Implement AI-powered ERP components using Java, Quarkus, and PostgreSQL following established architectural patterns
Apply prompt engineering strategies designed by senior engineers to enhance ERP modules with natural language interfaces and conversational experiences
Integrate pre-trained machine learning models into ERP features including data classification, predictive analytics, and intelligent workflow automation
Implement RESTful APIs connecting digital assistant services with core ERP business logic based on provided specifications
Independently own medium-complexity features from implementation through deployment, ensuring code quality and performance
Conduct thorough testing and validation of AI-enhanced features including integration testing, prompt effectiveness validation, and performance verification
Participate actively in code reviews, incorporating feedback and learning from senior team members
Support entry-level engineers and interns with coding questions, best practices, and technical guidance
